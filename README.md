# CRYPTOE - Crypto made Easy

Cryptoe is a high-level crypto library providing 
interoperability between client-side web applications (run
in a browser, where the cryptographic primitives are provided via
the Web Cryptogarphy API) and server-server side
applications (in node.js)

**Cryptoe-node** is the version of cryptoe for node.js.
